# Email Spam Filtering

This repository contains the implementation of an **Email Spam Filtering** project using Python. The project is designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email data for effective classification.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for spam detection.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
- User-friendly script for testing new email samples.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MUTHIKAN/email-spam-detector.git
cd email-spam-detector
```

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model
To train the spam filter model, use the following command:
```bash
python emailspamfilter.py --mode train
```

### 2. Testing the Model
You can test the model on new email samples:
```bash
python emailspamfilter.py --mode test
```

### 3. Evaluate the Model
To evaluate the model on a test dataset:
```bash
python emailspamfilter.py --mode evaluate
```
